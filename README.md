Title: Data Cleaning Task

Description: This repository contains a cleaned version of the dataset following a series of preprocessing steps.


Changes Made:
Removed duplicate rows to ensure data uniqueness.

Handled missing values by filling them with the mean for numerical columns.

Standardized text values (e.g., converted gender entries to lowercase).

Converted date formats to a consistent type (dd-mm-yyyy).

Renamed columns to a uniform format (lowercase, no spaces).

Checked and corrected data types for accuracy.

Usage: The cleaned dataset is ready for analysis and can be used for any further data processing or modeling.
